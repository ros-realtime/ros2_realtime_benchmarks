# ROS 2 Real-Time benchmarks

## Introduction

A project to host ROS 2 real-time benchmark results. It includes benchmark results
for some ROS 2 benchmarking tools.

Some of the experiments included are run with the reference platforms used in the
ROS 2 Real-Time Working Group. For example, a Raspberry PI 4 real-time image
created with the [ros-realtime-rpi4-image](https://github.com/ros-realtime/ros-realtime-rpi4-image)
tool.
